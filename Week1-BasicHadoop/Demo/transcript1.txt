##########   First transcript, getting started -- up and running with the Docker container

##  To begin, I start Ubuntu within Windows terminal

## I have created a link to a Directory on my laptop where the local 
## copy of my Github repository is.   I will use that directory as my "work area"

hanks@Slaptop2:/home/hanks$ pwd
/home/hanks
hanks@Slaptop2:/home/hanks$ ls
repo-home
hanks@Slaptop2:/home/hanks$ ls -l repo-home
lrwxrwxrwx 1 hanks hanks 48 Mar 22 14:23 repo-home -> /mnt/c/Users/hanks/Documents/Github/cpsc5330-s23
hanks@Slaptop2:/home/hanks$ cd repo-home
hanks@Slaptop2:/home/hanks/repo-home$ ls
Docker  README.md  Week1-BasicHadoop  Week2-HadoopStreamingAndSqoop

## I just followed the link, now my current directory is the directory where the course
## repo is stored.  Now I want to start up a docker container with the class Docker image, 
## and a mount point between my Windows filesystem and the Docker filesystem

hanks@Slaptop2:/home/hanks/repo-home$ cd Docker
hanks@Slaptop2:/home/hanks/repo-home/Docker$ ls
README.txt  bda_class_image  run-image  run-image-with-mount

## This is the script that starts the container with a mount point.
## Notice I am linking the Laptop directory with a directory on the docker container
## with the name /weekly-code

hanks@Slaptop2:/home/hanks/repo-home/Docker$ more run-image-with-mount
LAPTOP_ROOT=/mnt/c/Users/hanks/Documents/GitHub/cpsc5330-s23
DOCKER_DIRECTORY=/weekly-code
IMAGE=hanksseattleu/bda_class_image:latest
DOCKER_SHELL=bash

docker run -it -v $LAPTOP_ROOT/$1:$DOCKER_DIRECTORY $IMAGE $DOCKER_SHELL

### Now I run the script, and expect the Docker image to start

hanks@Slaptop2:/home/hanks/repo-home/Docker$ run-image-with-mount

###  Beginning of A LOT of initialization log messages

[ ok ] Starting OpenBSD Secure Shell server: sshd.
2023-03-31 18:15:15,119 INFO namenode.NameNode: STARTUP_MSG:
/************************************************************
STARTUP_MSG: Starting NameNode


Initialization script completed
schemaTool completed

## Looks like the container started OK.  Notice the shell prompt changed -- that's 
## how I know I'm now talking to Docker container and not my laptop.

##  I want to see if the mount point is there in /weekly-code

root@b98dfb14329b:/# cd /
root@b98dfb14329b:/# ls
KEYS                          data                  etc          lib64  proc  srv  var
apache-hive-3.1.2-bin.tar.gz  dev                   hadoop-data  media  root  sys  weekly-code
bin                           docker-entrypoint.sh  home         mnt    run   tmp
boot                          entrypoint.sh         lib          opt    sbin  usr

##  I can now see that /weekly-code is a link to my local copy of the Github repo.
##  (I could make the link to wherever I want, but that's where the files I want to 
##  work with are located.

root@b98dfb14329b:/# ls weekly-code
Docker  README.md  Week1-BasicHadoop  Week2-HadoopStreamingAndSqoop
root@b98dfb14329b:/#
